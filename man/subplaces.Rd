\description{
The \code{subplaces} dataset contains simplified spatial
data for subplaces in South Africa
based on the 2011 Census.
This dataset includes the same attributes as \code{subplaces_high}
but with simplified geometries
(keeping approximately 20\% of the original vertices),
making it more suitable for visualization
and analysis that don't require high-resolution boundaries.
}
\note{
MDB refers to the Municipal Demarcation Board of South Africa.
This dataset is a simplified version of \code{subplaces_high},
created using \code{rmapshaper::ms_simplify()} with \code{keep = 0.2} to
retain approximately 20\% of the original vertices.
This reduces the file size to approximately 11 MB on disk
and 46 MB in memory, making it more manageable for visualization
and analysis that don't require high-resolution boundaries.
